 #SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are applicable to Flutter development using Dart.
##1-Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. In Flutter, this often translates to separating concerns like UI, business logic, and data handling into distinct classes or components. 
##2-Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code. In Flutter, this can be achieved through inheritance or composition. 
##3-Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In Flutter, this ensures that any class implementing an interface or extending another class can be used interchangeably without unexpected behavior.
##4-Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It is better to have multiple smaller, specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface. In Flutter, this promotes cleaner and more focused class design. 
##5-Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes). This principle promotes loose coupling and makes the code more testable and maintainable. In Flutter, this can be achieved through dependency injection or service locators.
